## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to fine tune and expand my knowledge of CSS.  I feel that I struggled a lot to manipulate the components into the proper format and learned a lot along the way.  

I utilized root variables for colors for the first time and found this to be a streamlined and confusion free method to use the same colors throughout the application. 

### Continued development

In order to continue development of this app I would utilize the data.json file to allow for dynamic adjustments to the values within the application.  

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with layout. I like the presentation and the examples were easy to follow.
